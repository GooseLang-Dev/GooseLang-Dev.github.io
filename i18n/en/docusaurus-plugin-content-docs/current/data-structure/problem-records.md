# Problem Records Data Structure & Model

## üìò Overview

The **Problem Records** module in GooseLang is responsible for tracking, storing, and managing all user submissions (attempts) for language learning problems. Each record captures a user's attempt, including timing, scoring, and evaluation results. This module is essential for analytics, progress tracking, rejudging, and leaderboard/statistics features. It acts as the historical ledger of user activity on problems, supporting both individual and aggregate reporting.

> **Note:** The judging and task queue logic in this module is currently incomplete and requires further development for robust, production-grade evaluation workflows. See the Code Review & Suggestions section for details.

## üîó Dependencies

- **MongoDB**: All records are persisted in the `record` and `record.stat` collections.
- **Problem Model** (`problem.ts`): Links each record to a specific problem.
- **User Model**: Associates each record with a user.
- **Contest/Task System**: Integrates with contest logic and the task queue for judging (currently incomplete).
- **Space Model**: For multi-tenant (space) support.
- **Event Bus**: Listens for events (problem/space deletion, judging, etc.) to maintain data integrity.
- **Utilities**: Uses helpers for time, projection building, and argument handling.

## üìê Data Structures

### Record Document (`RecordDoc`)
Represents a single user submission for a problem.

```typescript
export interface RecordDoc {
    _id: ObjectId;                // Unique record ID
    spaceId: string;              // Space/organization identifier
    pid: number;                  // Problem ID
    uid: number;                  // User ID
    score: number;                // Final score for this attempt
    pcid?: ObjectId;              // (Optional) Contest/problem collection ID
    time?: number;                // Time spent on this attempt (ms)
    startAt?: Array<Date>;        // Start timestamps for tracking progress
    endAt?: Array<Date>;          // End timestamps for tracking progress
    isJudged?: number;            // Judging status: -1 (not judged), 0 (partial), 1 (judged)
    questionRecod?: any[];        // Array of question-level submission details (structure is flexible)
}
```

#### Field Explanations
- **_id**: MongoDB ObjectId, unique for each submission.
- **spaceId**: Enables multi-tenant support; all queries are scoped by space.
- **pid**: Links to the problem being attempted.
- **uid**: The user making the submission.
- **score**: The computed score for this attempt (after judging).
- **pcid**: Used for contest or grouped problem attempts.
- **time/startAt/endAt**: Used for analytics, time tracking, and progress visualization.
- **isJudged**: Indicates judging status; important for UI and analytics.
- **questionRecod**: Stores per-question details (answers, scores, etc.); currently loosely typed and should be standardized for future analytics.

### Record Statistics Document (`RecordStatDoc`)
Aggregates summary statistics for a user's attempts on a problem.

```typescript
export interface RecordStatDoc {
    _id: ObjectId;
    spaceId: string;
    pid: number;
    uid: number;
    time: number;
    score: number;
}
```
- Used for leaderboards, analytics, and fast queries on user performance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Methods & Logic

All methods are static on the `RecordModel` class.

## üß™ Usage Patterns

- **Submission Flow:** When a user submits a solution, `add` is called to create a record, then `judge` is called to queue it for evaluation. After judging, `update` is used to store results.
- **Analytics:** `stat`, `getMulti`, and `count` are used for dashboards and reporting.
- **Rejudging:** `reset` and `judge` are used when problems or test data change.
- **Cleanup:** Event listeners ensure records are deleted when problems or spaces are removed.

## üß† Code Review and Suggestions

- **Incomplete Judging/Task Logic:**
  - The judging and task queue logic is not fully implemented. The `judge` method and related task integration require significant development to support robust, asynchronous evaluation and result handling. This is a critical area for future work.
- **questionRecod Field:**
  - Currently typed as `any[]`, which limits type safety and analytics. **Recommendation:** Define a strict schema/interface for question-level details to enable robust analytics and UI features.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Some methods could benefit from more explicit error handling and validation, especially for partial updates and edge cases.
- **Dead Code/Legacy:**
  - No major dead code, but some TODOs and comments suggest future enhancements (e.g., deprecating certain config patterns).
- **Indexing:**
  - Indexes are well-defined for common queries, but as analytics grow, consider reviewing index coverage for new reporting needs.
- **Event Handling:**
  - Event-driven cleanup is robust, but ensure all new features trigger appropriate events for data integrity.
- **Documentation:**
  - Inline code comments are sparse in some areas. Consider adding more docstrings for complex logic.

## üìù File Structure

- `src/model/record.ts`: Main model logic and event listeners
- `src/interface.ts`: TypeScript interfaces for `RecordDoc`, `RecordStatDoc`, and related types
- `record.stat` (MongoDB collection): Stores summary statistics
- `record` (MongoDB collection): Stores all submission records

## üìå Notes / Observations

- **Design Choice:** The separation of `RecordDoc` and `RecordStatDoc` enables both detailed and summary analytics.
- **Extensibility:** The model is designed for future analytics and reporting, but standardizing flexible fields (like `questionRecod`) will be important.
- **Integration:** The module is tightly coupled with the problem, contest, and user systems, and is event-driven for data integrity.
- **Multi-Tenancy:** All queries are scoped by `spaceId` for robust multi-tenant support.
- **Performance:** Indexes and batch operations are used for efficiency, but should be reviewed as usage patterns evolve.
- **Maintainability:** The codebase is modular and event-driven, but would benefit from stricter typing and more comprehensive inline documentation.
- **Critical TODO:** The judging/task queue logic must be completed and thoroughly tested before this module can be considered production-ready for evaluation workflows.
