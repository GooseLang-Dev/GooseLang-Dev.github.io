## 🎯 Development Considerations

When getting started with GooseLang development, understand these two main areas:

### Quick Start Guidance

**For Frontend Development:**
- Use [Input Form](/dev/category/input-form) templates for all form components
- Use [Media Form](/dev/category/media-form) for image/audio handling
- Understand the hybrid SSR + React architecture

**For Backend Development:**
- Follow the Database → Handlers → Webpage flow for GET requests
- Follow the Webpage → Handlers → Database flow for POST requests
- Work with Nunjucks templates and markdown-it processing

---

## 🎨 Frontend Development Deep Dive

### Styling Architecture

- **Foundation UI CSS Framework**: Uses **partial Foundation UI** (https://get.foundation/sites/docs/) - specifically only the `.css` parts rewritten in `.styl` (Stylus) files
- **No JavaScript Dependencies**: Foundation's JavaScript components are NOT used - only CSS grid, typography, and basic component styles are adapted for layout
- **Stylus Preprocessing**: All styles use Stylus (`.styl` files) with shared imports from `common/` directory
- **Page-Specific Styles**: Define as `pagename.page.styl` under `pages/` directory
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: Defined in `breakpoints.json` and used with Rupture mixin system

### ⚛️ React Integration

- **Client-Side Interactions**: React is used specifically for **on-page UX user interactions** and dynamic components
- **Custom Reusable Components**: Extensive library of custom UI components with TypeScript support
- **SSR Templates**: Server-side rendered HTML templates work alongside React components
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Traditional server-rendered pages enhanced with React for interactive elements

### 🧩 Component Architecture

- **Input Forms**: Use pre-defined input templates in [Input Form](/dev/category/input-form) for all form components
- **Media Handling**: Use pre-defined media-form in [Media Form](/dev/category/media-form) for image/audio showcase and upload functionality
- **Monaco Editor Integration**: Custom Monaco editor setup with language support
- **Icon System**: Iconify integration for unified icon interface

---

## 🔧 Backend Development Deep Dive

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

- **Nunjucks Templating Engine**: Primary template engine for HTML generation
- **Markdown-it Integration**: Advanced markdown processing with custom plugins (KaTeX, Mermaid, media embeds)
- **Template Hierarchy**: Layout inheritance system (`layout/basic.html` → `layout/html5.html`)
- **Custom Filters**: Extensive Nunjucks filters for markdown, JSON, XSS protection, and content processing

### 📊 Data Flow Patterns

**GET Method (Loading Data):**
```text
Database → Handlers → Webpage
```

**POST Method (Updating Data):**  
```text
Webpage → Handlers → Database
```

### 🛠️ Key Backend Technologies

- **Template System**: Nunjucks with custom loader supporting development and production modes
- **Markdown Processing**: markdown-it with plugins for KaTeX, Mermaid, media embeds, XSS protection
- **Content Management**: Multilingual content support with language-specific rendering
- **File Handling**: Custom file URL processing and secure path resolution
- **XSS Protection**: Built-in XSS filtering integrated into markdown and template rendering

### ⚠️ Critical Development Notes

1. **Template Caching**: Development mode uses `noCache: true` for hot reloading
2. **Security**: XSS protection is deeply integrated - never bypass the built-in filters
3. **Content Processing**: Markdown content supports multilingual objects with automatic language selection
4. **Performance**: Template rendering is monitored - renders over 5000ms are logged as errors

## 🧩 UI Components & Templates

GooseLang provides a comprehensive component library for consistent UI development across the platform.

### 📝 Standard Form Components

For all form-related UI development, use the standardized component templates:

- **[Input Form Components](/dev/category/input-form)**: Complete documentation for text inputs, textareas, selects, checkboxes, radio buttons, and switches
- **[Media Form Components](/dev/category/media-form)**: Comprehensive guide for image handling, audio components, audio buttons, and Iconify integration

### 🔧 Core Component Library

The platform includes several highly reusable components:

- **AutoComplete System**: Advanced search and selection with async data loading, drag-and-drop sorting, and keyboard navigation
- **Editor Components**: Monaco code editor and markdown editor with syntax highlighting and multilingual support
- **Dialog System**: Modal dialogs for information, actions, and confirmations
- **Icon System**: Unified Iconify integration for consistent iconography

### 📚 Component Documentation

For detailed component specifications, implementation examples, and usage guidelines, refer to the dedicated component documentation sections linked above. These provide comprehensive coverage of:

- Component APIs and props
- Implementation examples
- Styling guidelines
- Best practices and common patterns

## 🔌 Plugin System

GooseLang is built on a comprehensive plugin-based architecture using the **Cordis** dependency injection framework, enabling modular development and extensibility.

### Key Plugin Features

- **Dynamic Loading**: Hot plugin load/unload support
- **Event-Driven**: Rich event hook system for extensibility
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support throughout
- **Configuration Management**: Schema-driven config validation

### Core Plugins

The platform includes essential plugins for authentication, search, translation, speech synthesis, and more. Each plugin provides specific functionality while integrating seamlessly with the core system.
